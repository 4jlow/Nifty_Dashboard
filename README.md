# Nifty Dashboard

KPI Assessment on Nifty500 Data. Deployed dashboard at https://4jlows.shinyapps.io/nifty_dashboard/

Snapshot of Nifty500 Stock Index from bottom of covid crash. Assessed potential KPIs that would be desirable to potential stakeholders.
Slapped a quick regression model to see if the industry of a company was a factor in sales growth. Funnily only healthcare
had a statistically significant change in sales growth, which makes sense since covid resulted in alot of panic buying
